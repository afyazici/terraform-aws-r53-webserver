# terraform-ansible-aws-webserver
This project aims to automate infrastructure setup on AWS using Terraform and Ansible. It launches AWS EC2 instances, configures them with Apache web servers, and secures them with SSL certificates using Certbot. By defining infrastructure as code, this project aims to provide a repeatable, scalable, and securely deployable architecture.
